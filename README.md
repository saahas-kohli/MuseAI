## Credits

This project was written by Daniel Fields (dfields@uchicago.edu) and Saahas Kohli (skohli2@g.ucla.edu).

Thanks to Meta for their research into single-stage transformer language models, efficient token interleaving patterns,
and ablation methods, as it was instrumental in enabling us to implement conditional music generation.
